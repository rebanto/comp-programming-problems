# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various competitive programming problems, primarily from USACO (USA Computing Olympiad), along with foundational data structure implementations. **All solutions are implemented in C++.**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, generally by competitive programming contest, theme, or data structure category. Each problem or data structure implementation typically resides in its own sub-directory and contains:

* `.cpp` file: The C++ source code for the problem solution or data structure implementation.
* `.in` file: Sample input for the problem (where applicable).
* `.out` file: Expected output for the corresponding sample input (where applicable).

## Contents Overview

This repository contains my practice and solutions related to:

* **USACO Problems:** Solutions to problems encountered during USACO contests and training.
* **Other Competitive Programming Problems:** Solutions to problems from various online judges and contests (e.g., Codeforces).
* **Preliminary Data Structures Practice:** Implementations of fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and other basic algorithms.

## Contributing

This is a personal repository for my competitive programming practice and learning journey. While I don't typically accept external contributions for problem solutions, feel free to open an issue if you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement.
